Sabriel lives in a small town near The Wall which divides the Old Kingdom from the New Kingdom. In the Old Kingdom charter magic is rife in the land. Necromancers create armies of the dead and it's the Abhorsen's job to keep the dead down by travelling into the river of Death. Sabriel's father is the current Abhorsen and he has gone missing.
